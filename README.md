# Professional Practice Group Project
 The Final Project for Professional Practice, Semester 1 2020

## Task 1
Your team is tasked to build an "AI" interviewer (using C#).

Your task is to produce a programme that runs in the console and acts like an "artificial intelligence" interviewing the user.

Requirements:

Asks a wide range of questions
Some questions depend on the answers to previous questions
Some answers are remembered and come back as part of later questions
The programme never ends – it can go back and re-ask questions and overwrite previous answers
The “AI” picks up on inconsistent answers (e.g. if the user answers one question with a yes and later contradicts this, the AI will respond accordingly)
 Ideas for the “AI”:

Decision has been made to create a AI that will check in with the user and find out how they are. Based on their reply the AI will ask a series of follow-up questions that will push the user to explore.....

Your team will present its programme in a team presentation after the mini-project.

How do you hand it in?

This time you are going to take a much more technical approach to group work. Your team should work in a shared repo in GitHub. Each team member will work in their own clone of this repo and push their changes to the remote to integrate their work. Make sure you commit often and that your commit messages communicate effectively to your team about what you have changed. You should all use plenty of code commenting.
