# Professional Practice Group Project
 The Final Project for Professional Practice, Semester 1 2020

## Task 1
Your team is tasked to build an "AI" interviewer (using C#).

Your task is to produce a programme that runs in the console and acts like an "artificial intelligence" interviewing the user.

Requirements:

Asks a wide range of questions
Some questions depend on the answers to previous questions
Some answers are remembered and come back as part of later questions
The programme never ends – it can go back and re-ask questions and overwrite previous answers
The “AI” picks up on inconsistent answers (e.g. if the user answers one question with a yes and later contradicts this, the AI will respond accordingly)
 Ideas for the “AI”:

IT support person
Doctor
Psychiatrist
Journalist
Teacher

Your team will present its programme in a team presentation after the mini-project.

How do you hand it in?

This time you are going to take a much more technical approach to group work. Your team should work in a shared repo in GitHub. Each team member will work in their own clone of this repo and push their changes to the remote to integrate their work. Make sure you commit often and that your commit messages communicate effectively to your team about what you have changed. You should all use plenty of code commenting.

## Task 2

Game
This semester your group will be tasked with making a command line adventure game. The most famous example of this genre is Colossal Cave Adventure or Zork, but there have been many excellent examples since then.

Your game can have any theme your group decides upon, as long as it is classroom-appropriate. You should try to include the following features:

Multiple "rooms" or locations that can be navigated between in a sometimes non-linear fashion.
Items that can be used, looked at or manipulated in some way.
An inventory so that the character can pick up and carry a certain number of items.
Decisions made by the player will impact on future plot features/directions.
This kind of game often has the following quirks:

A maze somewhere that is very difficult to navigate and required interpretation of clues.
The need for the player to backtrack to get items if they did not pick them up the first time.
The ability to save progress coupled with the possibility of failing/dying.
It might be worth doing some research (a possible presentation topic) in order to do some planning (another possible topic) so that your project management (another one) is successful. 

You should plan carefully so that you finish some basic features and core functionality really early on, only adding extra features once the main ones are finished and working. Make sure you use the talents of your group members to best advantage.
